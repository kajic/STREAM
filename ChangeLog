Version 0.5.0

The first public release version 

Version 0.5.1

Fixed minor bugs:

  - Relation Source operator

  - 2 bugs in partition window store

Version 0.6.1

  - Added stride parameter to range windows. 

	A stride must be specified immediately after the window operator
	RANGE. It is currently not possible to define a stride together
	with the ROWS operator. The stride is expressed using the same
	time specification as range.
	Finally, specifying a range smaller than the stride has undefined
	results.

	The following example query defines a window with a range of 10
	seconds, and a stride of 5 seconds:

	SELECT * 
	FROM S [RANGE 10 SECONDS STRIDE 5 SECONDS];

	When a tuple arrives with a time stamp which cannot be included in
	the 10 second range (because the distance from the oldest tuple in
	the window, to the most recently arrived, is greater than 10
	seconds), the window will make some number of 5 second
	strides. Most often one stride will be enough, but if the stream
	hasn't produced any tuples for more than 5 seconds, more than one
	stride will be required. Once the window has moved all tuples with
	time stamps between the windows original position and the new one
	will be dropped.

	
	The window [RANGE 1 DAY STRIDE 1 DAY] is equivalent to the ``Today
	Window'' described at http://infolab.stanford.edu/stream/cql-benchmark.html.  
	It can be used to define the ExpOutStr stream in the following
	way:

	SELECT RSTREAM(query_id, E.car_id, -1 * SUM(credit)) 
	FROM ExpQueryStr [NOW] as Q, AccTransStr [RANGE 1 DAY STRIDE 1 DAY] as T 
	WHERE Q.car_id = T.car_id;
