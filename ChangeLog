Version 0.5.0

The first public release version 

Version 0.5.1

Fixed minor bugs:

  - Relation Source operator

  - 2 bugs in partition window store

Version 0.6.1

  - Added stride parameter to range windows. 
    Examples:
	
	When filled, the following window will "stride" forward 10 seconds.
	Once moved, the window will be completely empty:

	select * from S [range 10 seconds stride 10 seconds];
	-----
	
	When filled, the following window will "stride" forward 5 seconds.
	The window will delete all tuples with time T lower than the new 
	window start time:
	
	select * from S [range 10 seconds stride 5 seconds];
	-----
	
	The following window is equivalent to the "Today Window" described at 
	http://infolab.stanford.edu/stream/cql-benchmark.html. It can be used 
	to define the ExpOutStr stream in the following way:

	SELECT RSTREAM(query_id, E.car_id, -1 * SUM(credit))
	FROM ExpQueryStr [NOW] as Q, AccTransStr[RANGE 1 DAY STRIDE 1 DAY] as T
	WHERE Q.car_id = T.car_id;
	-----
	
	The following queries define two windows which are semantically equal:

	select * from S [range 10 seconds stride 1 seconds];
	select * from S [range 10 seconds];
	-----

	All units previously supported by range are supported by the new 
	stride.
	A range smaller than the stride gives undefined results.
