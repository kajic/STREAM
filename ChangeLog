Version 0.5.0

The first public release version 

Version 0.5.1

Fixed minor bugs:

  - Relation Source operator

  - 2 bugs in partition window store

Version 0.6.1

  - Added stride parameter to range windows. 

	A stride must be specified immediately after the window operator
	RANGE. It is currently not possible to define a stride together
	with the ROWS operator. The stride is expressed using a time
	specification which follows the exact same rules as range.
	Finally, specifying a range smaller than the stride has undefined
	results.

	The following example query defines a window with a range of 10
	seconds, and a stride of 5 seconds:

	SELECT * 
	FROM S [RANGE 10 SECONDS STRIDE 5 SECONDS];

	When this window contains a set of stream tuples with time stamps
	ranging for 10 seconds, and a new tuple arrives with a time stamp
	which cannot be included in the range, the window will make a
	stride of 5 seconds. This will effectively delete all tuples with
	time stamps ranging from the windows original position to the
	windows new position.
	
	The following window is equivalent to the ``Today Window''
	described at http://infolab.stanford.edu/stream/cql-benchmark.html. 
	It can be used to define the ExpOutStr stream in the following
	way:

	SELECT RSTREAM(query_id, E.car_id, -1 * SUM(credit)) 
	FROM ExpQueryStr [NOW] as Q, AccTransStr [RANGE 1 DAY STRIDE 1 DAY] as T 
	WHERE Q.car_id = T.car_id;
