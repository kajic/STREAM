#
# Example Script 2: 
#

# 
# Register the stream S with 4 attributes
#

table : register stream S (A integer, B float, C byte, D char(4));

#
# The location of the stream.  When you actually run the script make sure
# that the relative path of the source is valid.
#

source : examples/data/S.dat

#
# Create a named query (view) over S which can be used in subsequent
# queries. The query selects all tuples of S with a even number in their A 
# attribute.
#

vquery : select * from S Where (A / 2) * 2 = A;

# 
# We need to name the output of the query so that it can referenced
# later.  The syntax for doing so is similar to syntax for registering
# base tables, except we use "vtable" identifier instead of "table"
#

vtable : register stream EvenS (A integer, B float, C byte, D char(4));

#
# Now we query this view
#

query : select * from EvenS Where A < 6;

#
# And its output goes to 
#

dest : qout
